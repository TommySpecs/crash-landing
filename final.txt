Now it's time to relax, you have your food, your water and a shelter to relax in but you're starting to feel a little cold.
It's time to make a fire and prepare for the next day.
Congratulations for surviving your first day.

hmmmmm that smoke your fire is creating is pretty noticeable, whats that noise? HEY LOOK! a ship looking for survivors of the crash! 

YOU HAVE BEEN RESCUED!!


  THE END!
