## ***Project Goals***


This portfolio project is my third for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and my goals are to display newly developed Python skills in this project.
I have built a text-based adventure game which is led by players choice, some of these choices will impact on the story progression.

## ***User Experience*** (UX)
 
### *User Stories*
As a user, I want to be able to:
To access a fun engaging story throughout the game.
Understand the aim of the story.
Have a straightforward way to read the game instructions from within.

## ***User Experience Design (UXD)***
### *Colour Scheme*




### *Image Sourcing*
Ascii text and Ascii Art has been added to the game. This is to help keep the player engaged and provide an aesthetically pleasing experience. The Ascii font was provided by [patorjk.com](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big&t=) and the font used was called "Big". The Ascii Art was provided by https://ascii.co.uk/art.


### *Game Flow*
I created the below flowchart to visualize the flow of the game and the functions used.

## ***Technologies Used***
### *Languages Used*
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))


### *Frameworks & Programs Used*
- [Github](https://github.com/)
    - To save and store the files for the site.
- [Lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
    - The Lucidchart app was used to create the app's flowcharts.




### *libraries*
colorama:
Fore & Style were imported from colorama to style the font, ASCII text, and ASCII art with color.
random:
randint was used throughout the project to produce random stats or pick a random index in the choice list for loot.
time:
time was imported to make use of the sleep function which was used throughout the adventure. It was implemented to increase the time between narrative text's showing and it also provided a level of intrigue for the user i.e. when opening a loot box

## ***Deployment***
GitHub
This project was developed by forking a specialized Code Institute template which simulates a terminal in the web browser.
Click Use this template
Name the repository
Launch using the Gitpod web extension
Pin project in Gitpod workspaces
Version Control
For version control the following steps were made:
Changes made to files in Gitpod
Files made ready for commit with command - git add .
For the commits the following command was run along with commit description - git commit -m "This is my commit etc"
To move the changes to Github the following command was run - git push
Forking the GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...
Log in to GitHub and locate the repository P3-Reclaim-The-Light
At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
Final Deployment with Heroku
The below steps were followed to deploy this project to Heroku:
Go to Heroku and click "New" to create a new app.
After choosing the app name and setting the region, press "Create app".
Go to "Settings" and navigate to Config Vars. Add a Config Var with a keyword called PORT and a value of 8000.
Still in the "Settings", navigate to Buildpacks and add buildpacks for Python and NodeJS (in order).
Leave "Settings" and go to "Deploy". Scroll down and set Deployment Method to GitHub. Once GitHub is chosen, find your repository and connect it to Heroku.
Scroll down to Manual Deploy, make sure the "main" branch is selected and click "Deploy Branch".
The deployed app can be found here.
