Winning free tickets to your dream destination seemed way to good to be true......
Unfortunately for you it was..
first your favorite mug's handle broke,
second you lost your lucky penny,
and third your plane was strike by massive amounts of turbulence
causing it to crash into an uncharted island.

You come to  still strapped into your seat
at least the fasten seatbelt light worked and you actually followed instructions.... 
your fellow passengers weren't so lucky
You climb out of your seat and into an unfamiliar jungle
