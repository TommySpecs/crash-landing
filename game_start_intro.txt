Winning free tickets to your dream destination seemed way to good to be true......
Unfortunately for you it was..
first your favourite mug's handle broke,
second you lost your lucky penny,
and third your plane was struke by massive amounts of turbulance causing it to crash into an uncharted island.

You come to  stll strapped into your seat
at least the fasten seatbelt light worked and you actullay followed instructions.... your fellow passangers weren't so lucky
You climb out of your seat and into an unfamiliar jungle
